    <h2 class="mb-2">About Klondike Solitaire</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Klondike Solitaire, often simply called Solitaire, is one of the most
      popular single-player card games in the world. Its classic design involves
      organizing a shuffled deck of 52 cards into four foundation piles in
      ascending order, each pile corresponding to one suit (Hearts, Diamonds,
      Clubs, and Spades). Players build these foundations starting with Aces and
      progressing up to Kings. The game combines strategy, skill, and a bit of
      luck, offering a relaxing yet engaging experience for players of all ages.

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-2">
      <li>
        <b>Setup</b>: The game begins with seven tableau piles, each containing
        an increasing number of cards from one to seven. Only the top card in
        each pile is face up; the rest are face down. The remaining cards form
        the stockpile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Objective</b>: Move all 52 cards to the four foundation piles,
        arranged by suit and in ascending order from Ace to King.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Gameplay</b>: Cards in the tableau can be moved in descending order
        and must alternate in color (e.g., a red 7 can only be placed on a black
        8).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stockpile</b>: Players draw from the stockpile, either one card at a
        time or three, depending on the chosen variation. Unplayable cards are
        moved to the waste pile, but they can be cycled through again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Empty piles</b>: Only Kings (or stacks starting with a King) can be
        moved into an empty tableau pile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Winning</b>: The game is won when all cards are successfully moved to
        the foundation piles.
